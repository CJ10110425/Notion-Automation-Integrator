Welcome to the Notion-Automation-Integrator repository! This project is dedicated to harnessing the power of the Notion API, combined with advanced web scraping techniques, to create an efficient and seamless automation experience.

## Purpose of the Project
This initiative was launched to assist the "續水" in reaching out to the Taichung Community Development Association. The aim is to inquire whether they are interested in crowdfunding to help local communities conserve water resources. Therefore, we needed detailed information about each association.

## Solution
I have successfully scraped data from every Community Development Association in each district of Taichung (data extracted from [Taichung Community Development Association](https://community.society.taichung.gov.tw/home.aspx)). 

I've gathered essential information such as 'Contact Person', 'Phone Number', 'Email', 'Community Name', 'Title', 'Population Count', 'Address', 'Contact Progress', 'Willingness Level', and 'Contact Method'. This data has been stored in separate CSV files for each district and then integrated into Notion's storage format. For efficient organization, different databases have been created in Notion for each district, where the scraped data is stored.
